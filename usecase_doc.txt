Unit Conversion DSL

The Unit Conversion DSL allows converting from and into different units of the same type (e.g. g to kg or vice versa, but not kg to km). It even supports conversions on entire
lists of the same type.
You start by defining some variables and assigning values to them with their unit operator to specify their type.
You can define a list with elements in it but the elements must be the same type.
You can have for loops that iterate over the elements of a list.s
You can have if-else statements to define conditions.
